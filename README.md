# Ask AI - Chrome Extension 

## Description
**Ask AI** is a Chrome extension built for the Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025.
It integrates all of Chrome’s built-in AI APIs, such as **Prompt, Summarizer, Translator, Writer, Rewriter, and Proofreader**, to make web browsing, reading, and writing effortless.

With **Ask AI**, you can summarize long articles, rewrite or proofread text, translate between languages, or generate new content; all directly in your browser, and even offline once models are downloaded.

## Features

* **Proofread:** Fix typos and grammar issues using the Proofreader API.
* **Translate:** Translate any selected text into your preferred language with the Translator API.
* **Rewrite:** Rephrase or adjust tone using the Rewriter API.
* **Offline Support:** Once AI models are downloaded, the extension runs completely offline, keeping your data private.
